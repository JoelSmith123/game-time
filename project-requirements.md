start with our two characters on opposite sides of the canvas, facing each other in the middle.
on start, the two characters head for each other
on keypress, the character target of the keypress will move in the direction of the specified keypress
each character creates a path showing the history of where it's been
when a character collides with either its own path, its opponents path, or the wall as specified by the canvas, the offending 
  character has lost the game, and a point goes to its opponent.
each game lasts a number of rounds
after each round the characters speed increases
